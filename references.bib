	abstract = {The Affordable Care Act is improving access to and the affordability of a wide range of health care services. While dental care for children is part of the law?s essential health benefits and state Medicaid programs must cover it, coverage of dental care for adults is not guaranteed. As a result, even with the recent health insurance expansion, many Americans face financial barriers to receiving dental care that lead to unmet oral health needs. Using data from the 2014 National Health Interview Survey, we analyzed financial barriers to a wide range of health care services. We found that irrespective of age, income level, and type of insurance, more people reported financial barriers to receiving dental care, compared to any other type of health care. We discuss policy options to address financial barriers to dental care, particularly for adults.},

	abstract = {With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions of low-income adults gained health coverage. We examined how the ACA?s expansion of Medicaid eligibility affected dental coverage and the use of oral health services among low-income adults, using data from the National Health Interview Survey from the period 2010?18. We found that the ACA increased rates of dental coverage by 18.9 percentage points in states that provide dental benefits through Medicaid. In terms of utilization, expansion states that provide dental benefits saw the greatest increase in people having a dental visit in the past year (7.2 percentage points). However, there was no significant change in the overall share of people who had a dental visit in the past year, although the expansion was associated with a significant increase in this metric among White adults. The expansion was also associated with a 1.4-percentage-point increase in complete teeth loss, which may be a marker of both poor oral health and the potential gaining of access to dental services (with subsequent tooth extractions). Our findings suggest that in addition to expanded coverage, policies need to tackle other barriers to accessing dental care to improve population oral health.},

In this Opinion article, Plowrightet al. present an integrative conceptual and quantitative model that reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans., Zoonotic spillover, which is the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon. Zoonotic spillover requires several factors to align, including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infection. In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in space and time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or prevent spillover events. This work provides a foundation for transdisciplinary investigation of spillover and synthetic theory on zoonotic transmission.},

	abstract = {Background
With continuous global COVID-19 outbreak, differing case numbers and mortality rates are observed. While actual case numbers appear vague, mortality numbers related to COVID-19 seem more precise. In this study, we used the mortality rate as the main indicator to evaluate the extent of underreporting and underdetection of COVID-19 cases.

Methods
We have analyzed all available data provided by the World Health Organization on the development of international COVID-19 cases and mortality numbers on March 17th, 2020. A crude case-fatality risk (cCFR) and adjusted case-fatality risk (aCFR) was calculated for China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Iran and the United States. Additionally, a fold-change (FC) was derived for each country.

Results
The highest aCFR and FC were detected for Spain. Based on their FC values, an extremely high number of undetected COVID-19 cases was displayed in France, the United States, Italy and Spain. For these countries, our findings indicate a detection rate of only 1–2\% of total actual COVID-19 cases.

Conclusions
Due to limited testing capacities, mortality numbers may serve as a better indicator for COVID-19 case spread in many countries. Our data indicate that countries like France, Italy, the United States, Iran and Spain have extremely high numbers of undetected and underreported cases. Differences in testing availability and capacity, containment as well as overall health care and medical infrastructure result in significantly different mortality rates and COVID-19 case numbers for each respective country.},

	abstract = {Zoonoses originating from wildlife represent a significant threat to global health, security and economic growth, and combatting their emergence is a public health priority. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their emergence remains rudimentary. Here we update a global database of emerging infectious disease (EID) events, create a novel measure of reporting effort, and fit boosted regression tree models to analyze the demographic, environmental and biological correlates of their occurrence. After accounting for reporting effort, we show that zoonotic EID risk is elevated in forested tropical regions experiencing land-use changes and where wildlife biodiversity (mammal species richness) is high. We present a new global hotspot map of spatial variation in our zoonotic EID risk index, and partial dependence plots illustrating relationships between events and predictors. Our results may help to improve surveillance and long-term EID monitoring programs, and design field experiments to test underlying mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence.},

To win elections in a democracy, the elite may increase public spending for disaster mitigation in favor of voters' demands. Democracy also empowers civil society and stimulates social spending, which benefits vulnerable citizens. Thus, a strong state capacity effectively reduces human vulnerability, especially in a democracy. I used panel data from 150 countries between 1995 and 2009 to demonstrate the relationship among state capacity, democracy, and the impact of disasters. After controlling for the density and magnitude continuity of natural-disaster hazards, the empirical results I obtained from the multilevel models indicate that democracy reduces the disaster mortality rate, and a strong state capacity mitigates the effect of a disaster on a population, especially in a democracy. I also found that state capacity and democracy are more effective in preventing human losses caused by predictable disasters such as floods and storms, rather than earthquakes.},

Emergency preparedness for, response to, mitigation of, and recovery from natural disasters that are bases for sustainable development requires sound impact assessments at proper spatial and temporal scales. This research provides spatial–temporal views of world natural disasters recorded in the EM-DAT database for the period of 1900-2015. Views of natural disaster impacts in terms of human fatalities, injuries, affected, and property damages are summarized and ranked at the world, continent, and country levels and by decade and the whole period. Top 10, 20, and 30 out of 221 countries are highlighted and referenced with the world totals. Correlates of country disaster impacts with social-economic attributes are explored. While countries with significant disaster impacts are found in all continents, large developing countries (e.g. China, India) or developed countries (e.g. United States, Germany) lead the global natural disaster hotspots, which are small in numbers but large in total disaster losses. Such global inter-country views of natural disaster impacts provide useful insights for sustainability policy-making relevant to international and national humanitarian efforts towards natural disasters.},

However, its theoretical framework is limited by its omission of findings from disaster social science literature, and its lack of examinations of marathons of domestic natural disasters. Using the August 2014 Yunnan (China) Television Station broadcast The Special Report on the August 3 Earthquake in Ludian, Yunnan, we conduct a qualitative content analysis to empirically examine the disaster marathon concept for natural disasters. During the content analysis, three themes emerge: authorities’ command and control, the involvement of armed forces, and convergence of social support. Our case study findings contradict the disaster marathon conceptualization and conclude that the local television coverage following a natural disaster can also be performed as a series of conventional media events and is consistent with the established disaster coverage literature.},

Thus, a strong state capacity effectively reduces human vulnerability, especially in a democracy. I used panel data from 150 countries between 1995 and 2009 to demonstrate the relationship among state capacity, democracy, and the impact of disasters. After controlling for the density and magnitude continuity of natural-disaster hazards, the empirical results I obtained from the multilevel models indicate that democracy reduces the disaster mortality rate, and a strong state capacity mitigates the effect of a disaster on a population, especially in a democracy. I also found that state capacity and democracy are more effective in preventing human losses caused by predictable disasters such as floods and storms, rather than earthquakes.},

	abstract = {Natural disasters causing human, economic, or environmental losses include all types of geophysical, meteorological, hydrological, climatological, or biological events that disturb human and natural environments. Emergency preparedness for, response to, mitigation of, and recovery from natural disasters that are bases for sustainable development requires sound impact assessments at proper spatial and temporal scales. This research provides spatial–temporal views of world natural disasters recorded in the EM-DAT database for the period of 1900-2015. Views of natural disaster impacts in terms of human fatalities, injuries, affected, and property damages are summarized and ranked at the world, continent, and country levels and by decade and the whole period. Top 10, 20, and 30 out of 221 countries are highlighted and referenced with the world totals. Correlates of country disaster impacts with social-economic attributes are explored. While countries with significant disaster impacts are found in all continents, large developing countries (e.g. China, India) or developed countries (e.g. United States, Germany) lead the global natural disaster hotspots, which are small in numbers but large in total disaster losses. Such global inter-country views of natural disaster impacts provide useful insights for sustainability policy-making relevant to international and national humanitarian efforts towards natural disasters.},

	abstract = {Disaster marathon was proposed by media communication scholars to differentiate the genre of disaster television broadcasting from media events. However, its theoretical framework is limited by its omission of findings from disaster social science literature, and its lack of examinations of marathons of domestic natural disasters. Using the August 2014 Yunnan (China) Television Station broadcast The Special Report on the August 3 Earthquake in Ludian, Yunnan, we conduct a qualitative content analysis to empirically examine the disaster marathon concept for natural disasters. During the content analysis, three themes emerge: authorities’ command and control, the involvement of armed forces, and convergence of social support. Our case study findings contradict the disaster marathon conceptualization and conclude that the local television coverage following a natural disaster can also be performed as a series of conventional media events and is consistent with the established disaster coverage literature.},
