# Overview of Disaster Literature

To understand the relationship between state capacity and disaster outcomes, we must first understand the context within which these questions arise. 

While natural hazards and the disasters associated with them are largely singular events, the aftermaths are not. Through synthesizing theory from both the social and physical sciences, @gallopin2006linkages addresses this phenomenon, providing a framework with which to observe reactions to socio-ecological events. @gallopin2006linkages breaks the aftermath of a disaster into three components: vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity. Vulnerability refers to how a nation fares shortly after being struck by a disaster and depends on two key categories: exposure to the disaster and sensitivity to disasters. How exposed a community is to a disaster is determined by the strength and scope of the disaster [@adger2006vulnerability, @kasperson2005vulnerable], while sensitivity indicates how affected or changed the community is as a result of the disaster [@gallopin2003box]. Similar to how certain age or genetic traits can affect how sensitive a person is to particular diseases, some nations or communities are more sensitive to natural disasters. Resilience, the second component of  disaster response mentioned by @gallopin2006linkages represents the ability of a community to cope with a disaster and respond positively, in other words, whether a community is able to rebuild effectively. The third component identified by @gallopin2006linkages is adaptive capacity, defined as a community's ability to not only be resilient, but to improve its condition in the face of a future similar threat. While resilience largely relates to a community "getting back on their feet" and recreating what was lost, adaptive capacity includes that, but goes a step further and includes the idea of "building back better" so that future hazards do not have the same disastrous affects on the community as before.

These three components of disaster response map neatly onto the temporal aspect of natural disaster responses: the immediate, medium, and long terms. Vulnerability largely plays a role both during and in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, resilience determines the rebuilding process or medium-term aspect of disaster response, and adaptive capacity determines the long-term outcomes of the community if another similar disaster is to hit the community or nation.

Much scholarly work exists on the relationship between natural disaster outcomes and state capacity, but the majority of research focuses on short-term vulnerability to natural disasters [@kahn2005death, @lin_governing_2015, @tol2021state], or on individual and private sector responses to disasters [@sawada2007impact, @drabo2015natural, @sawada2017natural, @rivera2014social], neglecting the roles that centralized states can play in disaster responses. While research on the longer-term aspects of disaster response do exist, the focus has been largely on post-mortem assessments of disasters striking developed nations [@dacy1969economies, @peacock2000hurricane, @aldrich2015physical, @wright1979after, @rossi1993community], or on the extremely long-term concept of post-disaster creative destruction which fails to consider the concept of adaptive capacity [@skidmore2002natural].

Post-disaster resilience and adaptive capacity, measuring medium and long-term disaster outcomes, are under-theorized areas of political science, indicating a critically important gap in the literature. While salient and topical, the lack of medium to long-term literature, especially pertaining to the developing world becomes understandable when considering lack of available data and the difficulty of gaining such data. To measure the recovery process, one must be able to measure a multitude of variables including the rebuilding of homes, infrastructure, businesses, etc. This is difficult in the best of circumstances but situations with limited record-keeping and government oversight make measuring resilience even more so. Measuring adaptive capacity requires researchers to compare two similar events happening to the same nation after rebuilding. This narrow scope of observation makes for a smaller potential sample size in addition to other challenges.

Unlike resilience and adaptive capacity, the relationship between short-term vulnerability and state capacity has been explored, but explored imperfectly. 


Exploring the relationship between log GDP per capita and disaster related deaths, @kahn2005death and @lin_governing_2015 argue that greater state capacity is associated with reduced disaster mortality among affected people.  @tol2021state builds on this work, arguing again that greater state capacity leads to less vulnerability to disasters, but unlike @lin_governing_2015 and @kahn2005death, instead of using log GDP per capita to represent state capacity, @tol2021state takes a more sophisticated approach, using taxation and the size of the national bureaucracy as proxies for state capacity. According to @tol2021state, nations with greater tax revenue suffer both fewer disaster-related deaths and have fewer people affected by disasters when they do strike. While claiming to represent the relationship between state capacity and disaster related deaths, all three of these papers fail to propose measures that meet concept: while they may be related, log GDP per capita, taxation as a percentage of GDP, and the size of national bureaucracies, while interesting measures, should not be considered as perfectly representing state capacity.

While the strength of a nation's economy can sometimes indicate state capacity, this relationship does not always hold true, and using log GDP per capita as a proxy for state capacity ignores the important literature on this topic. While @besley2010state describes a symbiotic relationship between strong states and strong economies, this relationship only holds true when the economy is tied to the welfare of the people. Countries in which governments depend on citizens for resources have incentives to help grow the economy so that they can extract more [@sanchez2020origins] --- this is a win-win situation in which the economy grows, and both the state and the people profit from this growth. This inclusive economic growth can be contrasted with countries experiencing a textbook "resource curse". In nations with vast natural resource stores, the economy is not necessarily tied to the welfare of the people, meaning that the state can gain resources and capacity without community benefit or buy-in [@ross1999political, @mehlum2006institutions, @sanchez2020origins]. @sanchez2020origins provides examples of both of these phenomena in the context of the Democratic Republic of the Congo through contrasting communities with two different resources: gold and coltan^[Coltan is a mineral used in many electronic devices.]. Because gold is mined in small, easily concealable nuggets, communities with large gold stores had a comparatively higher state presence. In order for the government, in this case armed bandits, to generate revenue from the area, they had to create a system of taxation because mining all of the gold would not be possible. @sanchez2020origins contrasts these communities with those in which large stores of coltan exist. Because this coltan cannot be acquired by regular people and requires specialized equipment to mine, to generate income from the resource, the government needs only to protect the resource and ensure that it is exported. Communities with large coltan mines unlike those with gold did not have present taxation systems, had lower state capacity, and increased levels of violence. @sanchez2020origins demonstrates the limitations of solely relying on the economy as a representation of a nation, or in the case of the paper, a local government's strength.

While still insufficient, @tol2021state's taxation as a proportion of GDP and the size of a nation's bureaucracy are more precise indicators of state capacity than log GDP per capita. For governments to effectively extract resources from citizens through taxation there must be a reasonable state infrastructure set up. A greater proportion of GDP coming from taxation suggests that a nation relies on the economic activities of its citizens to generate revenue rather than natural resources seperate from the population. Taxation also represents a social contract between citizens and their leaders, suggesting that the government has an obligation to act in the best interest of the people. While the relationship between taxation and state capacity is convincing, taxation is not state capacity and should not be operationalized as such. Similarly, the size of a nation's bureaucracy could suggest a strong government capable of carrying out policies, or, instead, a bloated and corrupt bureaucracy unable to perform its duties.

Having identified the shortcomings of the current literature both in terms of the time periods considered and the variables used to measure state capacity, the remainder of this chapter explores more comprehensive measures for state capacity and the mechanisms driving their relationship with all three stages of disaster outcomes.

<!-- @garnett2010enhancing provides an overview of different disaster responses in the developing world, finding through an assessment of numerous case studies that strategies focusing on local empowerment, organization and leadership, sustainable planning, and a free-market economy ultimately have more positive outcomes for affected communities. To understand the role state capacity and finer-grained components of state capacity have on disaster response it is important to understand the basis of state capacity.  -->

## Operationalizing State Capacity

A seemingly simple and self-evident concept, state capacity is rather difficult to define. As evidenced by the creative ways in which the disaster literature attempts to operationalize it, there is no single agreed upon measure of the concept. @hendrix2010 addressees this dilemma and breaks down the concept of state capacity into three components: military capacity, bureaucratic/administrative capacity, and the quality of a nation’s political institutions. In regards to natural disaster resilience and adaptive capacity, all three of these sub-areas of state capacity can be important indicators of response and rebuilding capabilities.







State capacity can be broken down into three key components: administrative capacity, coercive capacity, and extractive capacity (@mao2021, @hanson2018state). Adminstrative capacity pertains to the state's ability to carry out necessary tasks, the ability to create policies and implement them; Coercive capacity is indicative of the state's ability to "dominate society" or to engender compliance amongst citizens; and Extractive capacity pertains to the ability of the government to raise revenues from its territories and to use them to govern. It is important to understand the distinctions between these different components of state capacity because of how they each play a specific role in the state's overall capacity. 

In the context of natural disaster resilience and adaptive capacity, how quickly and effectively a community is able to be rebuilt is incredibly important. The longer it takes for homes and businesses to be rebuilt, the longer people are displaced and the economy stagnated. Like state capacity more broadly, bureaucratic efficiency relies upon the effective functioning of the government, but instead of ability, it focuses on how quickly governments can execute necessary functions ( @prendergast2003limits), in this case, how quickly a disaster response can be initiated.  When a disaster strikes a community, there is an initial large disruption with people being displaced, infrastructure damaged, and overall panic. How quickly a community can begin rebuilding and ultimately recover from a disaster depends on how quickly systematic efforts are initiated to begin and carry out the recovery process. A more efficient bureaucracy allows for less “red tape” that can make rebuilding difficult and lengthy. @garnett2010enhancing in its assessment of states that responded effectively to natural disasters found that the decentralization of disaster response agencies allowed for more efficient responses and faster action after a hurricane in Honduras. Issuing of a time-sensitive emergency mandate in Mexico after an earthquake resulted in faster rebuilding. Both of these events show that prioritizing swift action can facilitate faster rebuilding after a disaster. Additionally, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the UN's framework for effective disaster response, encourages the decentralization of post-disaster governance to encourage local empowerment/investment and a swifter response ( https://www.undrr.org/implementing-sendai-framework/what-sendai-framework). 

### Administrative Capacity

In order for there to be incentives for governments to act efficiently in the face of a disaster, citizens must be able to hold their governments accountable. To understand this relationship I use the principal-agent relationship as a model. In this framework there are two groups: the principals who are the main entity, and the agents who are tasked with making decisions in the best interest of the principals ( @eisenhardt1989agency). In a democracy, elected officials are the agents of the people, meaning that the citizens, or principals entrust them with acting in their best interest ( @garen1994executive) and in order to remain as agents, elected officials must be re-elected. This principal-agent relationship may be the missing piece in the puzzle of state capacity and disaster response. @back2008democracy argue the existence of a j-shaped relationship between democracy and state capacity, claiming that while a robust democracy has the most state capacity, authoritarian states have more than emerging democracies due to the strength of their bureaucracies. Both authoritarian states and robust democracies are able to have strong bureaucracies, but they differ in where they derive their power. Authoritarian states have a top-down structure governed by control and fear while strong democracies gain their power from public accountability, cooperation, and transparency --- the principal-agent relationship.  Both are effective at promoting state capacity because they have the ability to control people – one through community buy-in and the other through fear/the ability to punish. This relationship has implications for disaster recovery and response. @lin_governing_2015 finds evidence of a negative relationship between democracy and disaster mortality rates, suggesting that democratic regimes are better able to respond to and prepare for natural disasters. Interestingly, @lin_governing_2015 finds that voters typically prefer relief spending over spending on prevention, suggesting that the mechanism behind the relationship between democracy and disaster resilience is not due to political pressure to prepare for disasters but instead can potentially be attributed to the government's relationship with and obligation to its citizens in the aftermath of the disaster.

This democratic accountability to a nation's citizens is largely a product of the principal-agent relationship. Ideally, elected politicians act in the best interests of their citizens, making decisions about disaster recovery on their behalf. Information asymmetry and clientelism are seemingly the largest forces that can pervert accountability.  Information asymmetry happens when the principals do not have access to all necessary information to effectively hold agents accountable, thus distorting the relationship and leading to sub-optimal outcomes for principals and the community at large ( CITE). Clientelism or vote buying is another way in which this relationship can be distorted - when votes are bought, the principals have an added variable in how they assess and hold accountable their agents ( CITE). Much literature suggests that when voters have information about politician preferences and performance ( @platas2019closing, @carlson2015ethnic) they are better able to vote for politicians that align with their beliefs.  Similarly, when given information about corruption or about the role of government, citizens (and in some cases government officials) are able to hold officials accountable through voting them out of office ( @ferraz2008exposing, @gottlieb2016greater, @blattman2019eat), and in the case of politicians controlling bureaucrats, increased oversight of budgets can reduce corruption ( @raffler2016does).  Accountability also is impacted by clientelism, with vote buying in many cases perverting the principle-agent relationship so that politicians use citizens as agents to promote them to power ( @stokes2005perverse). Regimes with robust democracies in which politicians are held accountable for their actions can be expected to facilitate more efficient recovery processes. @cooperman2021natural provides evidence of this accountability link, finding that in years when politicians are up for re-election they are more likely to declare a state of emergency to allow funds to be sent in to facilitate the recovery process.

Unlike the work mentioned above in which citizens (principals) hold their politicians and governments (agents)  accountable through elections, in the case of disaster response, the time-line is much shorter, at least in the beginning, meaning that it is important to observe accountability not as an outcome in an experiment but as something embedded in the community. In addition to understanding how voters and people hold elected officials accountable, it is important to also understand how local people can feel empowered to support public works projects in their communities. In the economic development field, there is strong evidence that when community members are asked for and provide input on potential aid projects that projects focus more on the wishes of everyday people rather than political elites, leading to overall greater satisfaction with the project ( @olken2010direct, @beath2017direcct, @beath2018can). Evidence from Findings from @garnett2010enhancing support this argument. In their analysis of a number of catastrophic environmental events, they found that initiatives that directly involved citizens in rebuilding after a disaster were more successful and efficient. For example, in the aftermath of a 1998 flood in Bangladesh, the country’s free market allowed for grain to quickly be imported from abroad and was much faster than the government’s grain assistance. While not necessarily democratic accountability, the democratization of disaster response allows citizens to see a need and work together to meet it.

A subset of both state capacity and democracy, another key component of resilience is how inclusive or democratic institutions are within a country. Inclusive institutions are economic and political systems which allow people to freely participate and benefit from the fruits of their labors ( @acemoglu2012nations), they include legal systems that protect property and intellectual property rights and important bureaucratic jobs in both the public and private sectors that are merit-based. Nations with inclusive institutions are characterized by sufficient state capacity ( @fukuyama2012future, 2014) but also by opportunities for citizens to participate in both the economy and politics in the ways that they deem best fit ( @acemouglu2016paths). With inclusive institutions, there are fewer barriers to entry in markets, allowing an entrepreneur to see a need, enter a market, and potentially profit from their idea. Inclusive institutions allow for the free market to operate at its most optimal level, enabling people with talent and ideas to execute them regardless of previous privilege or position. In the context of natural disaster response and recovery, inclusive institutions will allow citizens to respond to community rebuilding needs even when the government or independent aid organizations fail to do so. When citizens are able to freely respond to what they perceive as the needs of themselves and their communities, overall disaster responses will be swifter ( @garnett2010enhancing).

### Coercive Capacity

Military capacity contributes to state capacity in three distinct ways: as an example of a public good, as an indicator of taxation abilities, and through its repressive capacity. Militaries are public goods, and when not used against their own citizens, investments in them are investments in the interest of all citizens ( @besley2009origins). The existence of a military can be one of the earliest indicators of the formation of a state, with @tilly1992coercion famously arguing that states arise because of a social contract between the governed and the governing - the government will protect the people from outside threats in return for payments in the form of taxes. Similarly, historical warfare is believed to serve as a predictor of modern-day state capacity, with states gaining capacity as they capacity forced to raise more taxes from their people to fight wars (@north1989constitutions). Importantly, this military view of state capacity is not universally applicable. While true for Europe and Asia, in the African context, this increased state capacity due to wars often manifests itself in the creation of special-interest states: states with both high fiscal capacity and levels of civil-conflict ( @dincecco2019africa). These special-interest states with strong militaries are ripe grounds for warlords which use their capacity not to protect citizens from outside threats but to stifle perceived internal threats and extract resources from the people ( @robinson2002states). While important, military capacity on its own does not fully explain state capacity and importantly, does not fully reveal the link between state capacity and disaster vulnerability.

### Extractive Capacity

[NEED TO ADD - maybe take something from administrative capacity]

While the actions of the government are important for how resilient a nation is to natural disasters, in order for actions to be carried out and efficiently, there  must be cooperation both between the government and the people (trust, accountability, democracy) and between people (social cohesion). Social capital and trust between the most vulnerable citizens and government officials is as important as the physical infrastructure rebuilding. When communities lack trust, they struggle to self organize and provide mutual aid to fellow citizens - this can result in less cooperation with relief and rebuilding projects ( @aldrich2015social).
 
Especially salient in the developing world, ethnicity plays an important role in national cooperation and in the sense of a common identity. The ability of a community to collectively act is largely determined by the number of people in the community, their ability to trust each other and work together, and in some circumstances, the heterogeneity of the community (part of the trust dynamic) (@ostrom2007collective).  Ethnicity plays a large role in community trust but it is not completely clear what the shape of the relationship is.  There is evidence that more diversity actually improves the odds of collective action ( @posner2004political, @robinson2014national), but simultaneously, it is believed that increased diversity makes it more difficult for people to cooperate and decreases collective action ( @ejdemyr2018segregation, @habyarimana2007does).  I suspect that there may be a u-shaped relationship between diversity and collective action where homogeneous and extremely heterogeneous communities will both have higher levels of social-cohesion and are able to effectively act collectively while communities with one or a few dominant ethnic groups struggle more. 

Ethnicity is just one factor that can influence social cohesion, religion and income also play a role in social cohesion. @kawachi1997social find that smaller differences in income between people result in people viewing their social environments as less hostile and more hospitable. Much literature exists on the role of a middle class in economic development ( @banerjee2007economic, @birdsall2000stuck, @easterly2001middle) and in strengthening democratic institutions ( @fukuyama2012future), suggesting that a robust middle class both increases state capacity and social cohesion. Regardless of the strength of the government response to a natural disaster, recovery and rebuilding still requires work by citizens. When citizens trust eachother and can cooperate more easily, inefficiencies are reduced and more time, energy, and resources can but put into the rebuilding process.

## A Theory of State Capacity and Disaster Response

The theory proposed here argues that while important to view the different stages of recovery separately (short/immediate term, middle/resilience term, and long/adaptive capacity term), the relationship seen between state capacity and natural disaster destruction in the short term will hold true and become even more important in the medium and long term. This project adds to the literature through expanding the scope of the already explored power of state capacity in four ways: 1) through using new, more comprehensive measures of state capacity to measure short-term disaster outcomes; 2) through exploring the role of state capacity in resilience; 3) through exploring the role of state capacity in the adaptive capacity of a community, and 4) through exploring the relationship between state capacity and rebuilding costs.

### Immediate Effects of Disaster --- Short Term

While the relationship between state capacity and short-term natural disaster outcomes has been well-explored (@lin_governing_2015, @tol2021state, @kahn2005death), there is no agreed upon measure for state capacity (@hendrix2010). Existing papers use different proxies for state capacity including log GDP per-capita (@lin_governing_2015, @kahn2005death), taxation, and the size of the national bureaucracy (@tol2021state). While these measures encompass crucial components of state capacity --- extractive capacity in the case of @tol2021state, and one part of administrative capacity in the case of @lin_governing_2015 and @kahn2005death --- they are rather narrow in scope and fail to capture all the factors that play a role in shaping a country's state capacity. As will be explained further in the next chapter (DATA EXPLANATION), I use a number of measures of a nation's state capacity: 1) A simple measure of state statistical capacity (@harsch2021), 2) A more complex metric sourced from 21 indicators (@hanson2013leviathan), and 3) individual indicators for administrative (Note to self: how long it takes for a law to be enacted), coercive (RER), and extractive (tax revenue as % of GDP) capacity (@hanson2013leviathan). I will further test the relationship between short-term disaster outcomes --- deaths and the number of displaced persons --- through measuring state capacity using the above-mentioned metrics. While I expect the relationship to be similar to those seen in @lin_governing_2015, @tol2021state and @kahn2005death, in order to be able to use these papers as a basis for my resilience and adaptive capacity arguments later on I must be able to prove that the effect exists for these measures of state capacity.

**H1:** *Greater state capacity (as measured by @harsch2021 and @hanson2013leviathan will correspond with fewer disaster-related deaths and displaced people immediately after the disaster.*

### Resilience --- Medium-Term Outcome

When rebuilding after the initial disaster, there are fewer things left to chance, meaning that there is more room for a capable state to take action and control how the situation is resolved. Even in situations in weaker or fragile states where much of the recovery is donor-driven, greater state capacity likely provides greater stability, support, and partnership to the aid organizations, helping them to be able to rebuild communities more quickly and efficiently. As defined by @gallopin2006linkages, resilience is a community's ability to cope with a disaster and respond positively, in short, whether a community is able to rebuild effectively. Effective rebuilding comprises of two components: 1) the speed of rebuilding, and 2) the cost of doing so. Ideally, a competent state will be able to facilitate a swift and reasonably priced rebuilding process. Incompetent states will result in people being displaced for longer than their more competent peers and also more expensive. Longer project durations and the mismanagement of resources can make the rebuilding process needlessly more expensive. Speed and cost of rebuilding are two different metrics and are measured differently, but are impacted by the same underlying mechanisms:

**1.** The ability of the government to ensure stability in the disaster-affected area;

**2.** The ability of the government to assess damages from the disaster;

**3.** How democratic a nation is; and

**4.** The ability to coordinate a response to the disaster, OR to work with an NGO/aid organization 

to coordinate a response

Disaster preparedness is derived from "certain unintended consequences of state building" (@lin_governing_2015), meaning that a nation's institutions and infrastructure set the pre-conditions that will determine how capable a state will be in coordinating a disaster response. Mechanism 1 explains this phenomenon. For a nation to effectively and efficiently rebuild, there must be stability within the affected area. I define stability as a state monopoly on legitimate violence (@weber1919), meaning that insurgents or armed actors are not vying for power or attempting to overthrow or replace the government. If a government can control its territory, it will be easier to coordinate a response, bring in outside help, and to rebuild without fear or the risk of additional destruction by violent non-state actors. Opponents of this idea may argue that in nations with particularly weak state capacity, insurgent actors may actually be better able to provide services and facilitate rebuilding than the actual government (@arjona2015rebel, @sanchez2020origins). While these non-state actors are by the very essence of their name "non-state", they operate as one, and while their capacity is not state capacity, they can contribute to peace and stability, meaning that the monopoly on violence in the area does not necessarily have to be through the state. Stability can be ensured in a number of ways including the deployment of the military to assist citizens in need and through a relationship of trust between the citizens and their government. This trust is especially important. If the people affected by the disaster trust that assistance will be provided, they will be more likely to cooperate with the government or aid organization and less likely to attempt to overthrow the government, making for a swifter and more coordinated response. Without stability in the region, the higher-level disaster response and rebuilding coordination will be much more difficult, causing the process to take longer and ultimately cost more money.

Once stability is established, meaning that a response is able to take place, the next mechanism that determines how resilient a nation is is the ability of the government to assess the damages done by the disaster. To effectively respond to any negative event, in particular a large-scale natural disaster, it is important to know what damage has been experienced. In the case of natural disasters, this damage includes the number of lives lost, homes destroyed, food-producing farms decimated, and the precise locations of these losses. Knowing both the degree and location of these losses allows for targeted relief efforts directed to the areas that need the most assistance. While these seem like relatively simple metrics, to be able to quantify losses state statistical capacity, or the maintenance of key records including a birth/death registry, population census, and agricultural census is of particular importance. Deaths and destruction may still be able to be counted without these records, but the process would likely be much more difficult and leave states partially blind to the initial conditions in their nations (@harsch2020). Without key statistical information, it is difficult to identify areas hardest hit, thus slowing the disaster-response and recovery process.

In addition stability, another key pre-condition to recovery is how democratic a country is. As mentioned in [LIT REVIEW/THEORY], democracy is a political example of the principal-agent relationship where the citizens (principals) elect leaders (agents) to act in their interest and in order to be re-elected, these leaders are incentivized to act in the best interest of the people. While not state capacity, but instead a mechanism that can lead to greater state capacity, a robust democracy will mean that leaders can expect to be held accountable for how they respond to a natural disaster, thus incentivizing them to respond to the utmost ability of the state. Democracy in this case may be acting as a sort of inverse indicator of state coercive capacity, showing that when government policy is driven by citizen engagement that citizens are more likely to comply. Interestingly, @lin_governing_2015 partially explored the relationship between democracy and disaster resilience, finding that voters prefer relief spending over preventative spending. Thus cementing the importance of the government's obligation to its citizens in the aftermath of the disaster. 

The third mechanism behind disaster resilience is the ability of the state to either coordinate a response to the disaster, or in the case of a donor-driven response, to work effectively with an NGO/aid organization to facilitate the rebuilding process. Rebuilding after a disaster requires intense coordination between national, state, and local governments, and between the government and the people. In order to rebuild, the damage must be assessed, a chain of command must be established, rebuilding plans must be made, builders must be hired, funds must be administered to the necessary stakeholders, and materials must be purchased, all while citizens and stakeholders are kept appraised of what is going on. This response requires a high degree of state capacity including as explained by @hendrix2010, administrative and bureaucratic capacity. It is through this component of state capacity that the actual response is initiated and carried out, making it the most important. 

Finally, while the ability of the state to enact post-disaster rebuilding programs and to effectively work with different aid organizations that are mobilized to help the situation, without compliance and cooperation from the people, it is difficult for these policies to be enacted. The government's coercive capacity, or ability to compel compliance with policies in place is essential for enabling an swift and efficient rebuilding process. If the people are not cooperative with government programs it can lead to panic buying of essential resources resulting in hoarding by the most wealthy, theft from construction sites, and overall mayhem as people fear that if they do not rake action for themselves that they will be left behind in the (literal) rubble.

While state capacity can be an important predictor of short-term disaster outcomes, I expect the effect to be even larger in the longer/resilience-term. When a disaster strikes a community, a lot of the damage is inevitable - no amount of good policy can totally prevent the destruction created by an earthquake or a tsunami. With the rebuilding process though, there is a lot more room for policy, good or bad to impact the outcome - the longer the time period, the more opportunities there are for strong states to make positive decisions that affect resilience outcomes. It is important to note as well that while the length and cost of the rebuilding process are different, they are ultimately affected by the same state capacity mechanisms.

**H2:** *The greater a country's state capacity, the shorter the rebuilding time period will be*

**H3:** *The greater a country's state capacity, the smaller the cost of rebuilding*

### Adaptive Capacity --- Long-Term Outcome

In addition to both the relationship between state capacity and short and medium-term outcomes, I am also interested in observing the relationship between state capacity and adaptive capacity. As defined earlier, adaptive capacity is the ability to "build back better" or to rebuild in a way that mitigates future risk to similar disasters (@gallopin2006linkages). Quite similar to my theory of resilience, my theory of adaptive capacity relies on four mechanisms:

**1.** The ability to assess damages AND identify the weak points or vulnerabilities that enabled the destruction; 

**2.** The ability to finance the use of disaster-safe practices

**3.** Cooperation and buy-in from stakeholders 

**4.** The ability to migrate if one wishes to a safer area

Mechanism 1 highlights the importance of having sufficient assessment infrastructure in place to be able to take stock of the damage shortly after the disaster to find whether infrastructure changes could have mitigated some of the damage. A key component of adaptive capacity is learning through assessing past vulnerabilities how to build back in a way that will mitigate future risk. In addition to having sufficient statistical capacity as needed above to assess the damage, to know what vulnerabilities the past infrastructure had to disasters requires assessments by professionals. Initiating and authorizing these assessments requires an additional level of planning and foresight by the government but can provide important insight into what went wrong in the past. For a government to be able to initiate this kind of post-mortem assessment in the midst of the aftermath of a disaster requires a significant level of capacity and an emphasis on proactive planning in addition to reactive rebuilding. In particular, administrative capacity, or the ability to enact policies is especially important in ensuring that these actions are indeed taken and taken quickly.

Mechanism 2 may seem self-explanatory, but disaster-safe rebuilding practices can sometimes be expensive (CITE), leaving governments and homeowners to decide between spending money they may not have on safer rebuilding practices or instead choosing to re-build homes just as they were before. Rebuilding homes in a more disaster-safe way may require additional aid, technological support, and education as to how and why these new ways of building can protect homeowners from future damage, all of which cost a significant amount of money.

In addition to the resources to rebuild in a disaster-safe manner, it is essential that there be community buy-in from the affected stakeholders. There may be a certain cultural significance tied to a certain way of building or stakeholders may not understand that by rebuilding a certain way that they may be safer when or if another disaster strikes. Even with the necessary technology and the finances to make it happen, if there is not community buy in, these changes will not be made. Mechanism 3 highlights the importance of a government's coercive capacity, or ability to convince citizens to act in a certain way. Educating local people both about how the technology works and how they themselves can use it will facilitate greater uptake and hopefully greater adaptive capacity.

Finally, and seemingly the most counter intuitive, a country's adaptive capacity, as measured by the number of deaths and displaced persons after the disaster is affected by the number of people who are in the community. In some situations in which climate change has resulted in certain communities permanently being at risk, the safest thing people can do is to leave and to move somewhere less susceptible. This comes with a number of cultural and ethical questions, but for the purposes of this study, I view people moving to safer areas a positive that will not only result in they themselves being at less risk, but will also result in fewer affected people when and if disaster strikes their original communities again.

Through assessing what went wrong in the past, engendering support for the new building measures among the affected population, aquiring significant resources, and allowing people to move away if they wish, communities can be rebuilt in a way that lessens potential future damage.
